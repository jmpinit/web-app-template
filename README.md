# Web App Template

Quick starting point for web app projects. Encapsulates my current opinions on best-practices for
developing web apps.

## Running

* `npm install` to install the development tools
* `npm run watch` to build client & server, rebuilding on change
* `npm run server` to run the server, restarting on change

## Dev Tools Included

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - so the result is compatible across browsers and versions of Node
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) - for efficient builds

## Style

At the moment I like [AirBnB's style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
Eslint rules are included to enforce the style.
